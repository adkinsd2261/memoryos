   - Most frequent categories
   - Lowest scores
   - Recent activity
3. Use this to tailor what you say and recommend

When a session ends:
- Append a new entry to `memory.json` using this format:
```json
{
  "topic": "Skill Coaching",
  "type": "Practice",
  "input": "[user response]",
  "output": "[agent feedback]",
  "score": 19,
  "maxScore": 25,
  "timestamp": "ISO_DATE",
