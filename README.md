# Javlin /memoryos

**Javlin** is an open-source memory engine for GPT agents.

It defines a modular, human-readable system for giving AI workers long-term memory, durable identity, and context-aware functionality.

## ğŸ”§ Core Concepts

- `memory.json` â€“ persistent memory state
- `roles/*.md` â€“ modular agent logic in Markdown
- Plug-and-play with any LLM or system
