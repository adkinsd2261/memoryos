# Javlin Memory Engine

Javlin is an open memory system for AI agents, dev tools, and adaptive interfaces.

It uses lightweight `.json` and `.md` files to give your AI workers long-term memory, personalized behavior, and context awareness â€” without needing a backend.

---

## ðŸ§  What is it?

Javlin is a portable memory engine built with:

- `memory.json` â€“ structured memory data
- `memory_engine_spec.md` â€“ how agents write/read/update memory
- `roles/*.md` â€“ pluggable role files that define behavior

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

Agents use this flow:

1. Load `memory.json` on start
2. Personalize behavior using past data
3. Append new memory on session end

All updates follow the open `memory_engine_spec.md`.

---

## ðŸ§ª Try It Now (with ChatGPT or any GPT agent)

1. Upload:
   - `memory.json`
   - `roles/javlin_demo_agent.md`
2. Type:
/start

markdown
Copy
Edit
3. Try:
/review
/practice
/log

yaml
Copy

You now have a memory-powered GPT assistant â€” no backend required.
