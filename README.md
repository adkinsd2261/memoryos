# Javlin Memory Engine

Javlin is an open memory system for AI agents, dev tools, and adaptive interfaces.

It uses lightweight `.json` and `.md` files to give your AI workers long-term memory, personalized behavior, and context awareness — without needing a backend.

---

## 🧠 What is it?

Javlin is a portable memory engine built with:

- `memory.json` – structured memory data
- `docs/memory_engine_spec.md` – how agents write/read/update memory
- `roles/*.md` – pluggable role files that define behavior

---

## 🔧 How It Works

Agents use this flow:

1. Load `memory.json` on start  
2. Personalize behavior using past data  
3. Append new memory on session end  

All updates follow the open `memory_engine_spec.md`.

---

## 🔁 How Memory Works (Lifecycle)

Each agent session works like this:

1. **Start** – Load the `memory.json` file  
2. **Adapt** – Use memory to shape behavior and responses  
3. **Append** – Add new memory entries based on what happened  
4. **Repeat** – Grow long-term learning over time

This makes the agent feel:
- Personalized  
- Evolving  
- Context-aware

All entries follow the open schema in `docs/memory_engine_spec.md`.

## 🧪 Try It Now (with ChatGPT or any GPT agent)

1. Upload:
   - `examples/memory_output_example.json`
   - `roles/javlin_demo_agent.md`
2. Type:
/start

Edit
3. Try:
/review
/practice
/log

yaml
Copy
Edit

You now have a memory-powered GPT assistant — no backend required.

## 🧭 Who This Is For

- AI builders (GPT, Claude, Ollama)  
- Devs building co-pilots or assistants  
- Toolmakers who need persistent agent memory  
- Educators or evaluators training AI workers

---

## 🧠 Why This Changes Things

Most AI agents start over every time.  
Javlin gives them **memory that lives outside the model.**

That means:
- No backend required  
- No vendor lock-in  
- No hallucinated context

Just `.json` + `.md` files — readable by devs and GPT alike.

It’s the simplest path to agents that **remember who you are, what you’ve done, and how to help you better** over time.
